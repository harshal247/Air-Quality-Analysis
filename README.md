# Air-Quality-Analysis


This project addresses the pressing issue of accurately forecasting variations in the Air Quality Index (AQI) across 453 cities in India, amidst deteriorating air qual- ity levels. The objective is to identify the most ef- fective predictive model among Auto-Regressive Inte- grated Moving Average (ARIMA), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) through a comprehensive comparative analy- sis. Leveraging advanced time series forecasting tech- niques, the study aims to contribute valuable insights for policymakers to implement preventive measures and address the complex challenges posed by air pollution. The main findings indicate that LSTM outperforms ARIMA and XGBoost in capturing seasonal trends, en- abling precise forecasting, thus demonstrating its effi- cacy for proactive air quality management and public health interventions.
