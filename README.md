# Air-Quality-Analysis

This project addresses the pressing issue of accurately forecasting variations in the Air Quality Index (AQI) across 453 cities in India, amidst deteriorating air quality levels. The objective is to identify the most effective predictive model among Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) through a comprehensive comparative analysis. Leveraging advanced time series forecasting techniques, the study aims to contribute valuable insights for policymakers to implement preventive measures and address the complex challenges posed by air pollution. The main findings indicate that LSTM outperforms ARIMA and XGBoost in capturing seasonal trends, enabling precise forecasting, thus demonstrating its efficacy for proactive air quality management and public health interventions.

### Motivation
Air Quality in Indian cities is curently a concerning issue, and it's deterioration demands immediate attention. The worsening air quality poses a direct threat to public health, leading to a potential increas in respiratory and other health issues. 

Accurate forecasting of the air quality index (AQI) is crucial for implementing timely preventive measures to mitigate the impact on health and the environment. By employing advanced forecasting techniques, I aim to provide decision-makers with valuable insights for effective environmental policies and publlic health strategies. The project serves as a proactive step toward managing and improving environmental conditions, by doing a comparative analysis of various models.
